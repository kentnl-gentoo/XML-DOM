Change History:

1.08 (enno)
- No changes - I messed up uploading to PAUS and had to up the version number.

1.07 (enno)
- added Node::isElementNode for optimization
- added NamedNodeMap::getChildIndex
- fixed documentation regarding getNodeValue. It said it should return
  getTagName for Element nodes, but it should return undef.
  (thanks to Aravind Subramanian at aravind@genome.wi.mit.edu)
- added CAVEATS in documentation (getElementsByTagName does not return "live"
  NodeLists)
- added section about Notation node in documentation

1.06 (enno) 11/16/1998
- fixed example in the SYNOPSIS of the man page
  (thanks to Aravind Subramanian at aravind@genome.wi.mit.edu)
- added test case t/example.t (it's also a simple example)

1.05 (enno) 11/11/1998
- added use strict, use vars etc.
- fixed replaceData - changed $str to $data
- merged getElementsByTagName and getElementsByTagName2
- added parsing of attributes (CheckUnspecAttr) to support Attr::isSpecified
- added XML::DOM::Parser class to perform proper cleanup when an exception
  is thrown
- more performance improvements, e.g. SafeMode, removed SUPER::new
- added frequency comments for performance optimization: e.g. "REC 7473" 
  means that that code is hit 7473 times when parsing REC-xml-19980210.xml
- updated POD documentation
- fixed problem in perl 5.004 (can't seems to use references to strings, e.g.
  *str = \ "constant";)

1.04 (enno) 10/21/1998
- Removed internal calls to getOwnerDocument, getParentNode
- fixed isAncestor: $node->isAncestor($node) should return true
- Fixed ReadOnly mechanism. Added isAlwaysReadOnly.
- DocumentType::getDefaultAttrValue was using getElementDecl 
  instead of getAttlistDecl
- Attr::cloneNode cloneChildren was missing 2nd parameter=1 (deep)
- NamedNodeMap::cloneNode forgot to copy {Values} list
- Element::setAttributeNode was comparing {UsedIn} against $self instead of {A}
- fixed AttDef::cloneNode, Value was copied wrong
