The XML::DOM code is fairly stable and has been used quite a bit.

========= DEPENDENCIES =========================================================

You need the following modules (all available at CPAN):

- XML::RegExp
- XML::Parser (At least version 2.28, 2.30 recommended)
	 If you are using XML::Parser 2.27, then you should download
	libxml-enno-1.02 from your local CPAN mirror.
- LWP::UserAgent (It's part of libwww-perl. If you don't have it, some test
		  cases may fail and you can't read files from URLs.)
- XML::Parser::PerlSAX (It's part of libxml-perl. You need at least version 0.06.
			If you don't have it some test cases may fail.)

I used PodToHTML-0.04 to generate the html documentation. You only need this
if you want to re-generate it.

========= INSTALLATION =========================================================

To configure this module, cd to the directory that contains this README file
and type the following.

	perl Makefile.PL

Alternatively, if you plan to install XML::Parser somewhere other than
your system's perl library directory. You can type something like this:

	perl Makefile.PL PREFIX=/home/me/perl INSTALLDIRS=perl

Then to build you run make.

	make

You can then test the module by typing:

	make test

See FAQ.xml for known problems.

If you have write access to the perl library directories, you may then
install by typing:

	make install

============= XML::DOM =========================================================

This is a Perl extension to XML::Parser. It adds a new 'Style' to XML::Parser,
called 'Dom', that allows XML::Parser to build an Object Oriented datastructure 
with a DOM Level 1 compliant interface.
For a description of the DOM (Document Object Model), see http://www.w3.org/DOM/

XML::Parser is a Perl extension interface to James Clark's XML parser, expat.
It requires at least version 5.004 of perl and can be found on CPAN.

This is a beta version and although there will not be any major API changes,
minor changes may occur as we get feedback
from the people on the perl-xml mailing list. [You can subscribe to
this list by sending a message to subscribe-perl-xml@lyris.activestate.com.]

============= Other packages ===================================================
XML::UM		      - Convert UTF-8 strings to any encoding supported 
			by XML::Encoding

XML::Filter::SAXT     - Replicates SAX events to several SAX event handlers 
		        (like the Unix 'tee' command)
XML::Filter::DetectWS - PerlSAX filter that detects ignorable whitespace and, 
			optionally, filters it. (Untested!) 
XML::Filter::Reindent - PerlSAX filter that can re-indent XML files.

XML::Handler::BuildDOM - Previously called XML::DOM::PerlSAX. Builds a DOM
			document from PerlSAX events.
XML::Handler::Composer - Yet another XML printer. This one supports printing 
			to other encodings.
XML::Handler::PrintEvents - Prints all PerlSAX events it receives to stdout. 
			Useful when debugging PerlSAX event filters/producers.
